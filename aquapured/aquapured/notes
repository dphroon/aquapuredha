ping (hex)          10 02 50 00 62 10 03 
try to set output   10 02 50 11 0a 7d 10 03 (10 %). 


OK, tag got this working for us.  I was able to  send (all in decimal)
16,2,80,17,10,0,125,16,3  
and got back
16,2,0,18,64,0,100, 16,3

So the 64 mean 3200ppm salt?  That is right about what it should be.  Actually, it is about 3400 typically.
Also, I sent 

16,2,80,0,0,98,16,3
and got back
16,2,0,1,0,0,19,16,3

Hi you need to send the percentage every 0.5 second. it will stop being remotely controlled after few seconds of not getting the packet with the setting. you may also just put it on a dedicated rs485 bus.

Here is what I sent and got back:

16,2,80,0,0 => 0,1,0,0
16,2,80,17,10 =>0,18,70,0 //70 is my ppm, 3500
16,2,80,20,1 =>0,3,0,65
The only response that ever changes is the 70 (ppm).  All else are always the same.

Also, I notice the aquapure does not mind getting extra data.  For example, 

16,2,80,0,98,16,3 = 16,2,80,0,0,98,16,3 = 16,2,80,0,0,0,98,16,3

Got the same response in each case.  I think the normal format is 

Header = 16,2
Destination 80
Command = 0 or 17 or 20
Data = X (only the 17, the set % command, seems to use this)
Checksum
End = 16,3

But apparently you can add as many data bytes as you want and it is fine.  
EDIT: I also found that 21 works as a command, but is almost identical to 17.  It sets the %, but divided by 10.  So 
16,2,80,21,50 will set the panel to 5%.

The 0x10, 0x02 is the start of packet indicator.  The 0x0C, 0x01 means from device 1 to device 12.  The 0x00 is just a zero, never saw it become anything else.  the 0x00 or 0x64 or 0x2D is the percentage in hex (0, 100, 45)
